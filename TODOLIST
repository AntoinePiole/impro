TODO atm :
 - Autorisation/authentification
Check that JSONs have the right shape when entering the back (with AJV for instance)
Implement passport
When connecting while isAuth is false, redirect to login/submit or an error 404 page with login ad submit in dashboard

- Missing features :
When viewing the page of a league we aren't in, add a button to request to join & handle those requests in the back and front
Clean up the shape of some pages (ie, league and user)
Handle match suggestions with back, with real matches with a special status & adapt get functions accordingly
Make a page to make a new league, add a link to it in the dashboard
Make a "home" page
Add calendars
Unify our way to handle dates

 - Images :
Actually get photos from the back
Have default images stored in the back
Handle all images displays with components

 - API :
Split our API into userAPI, leagueAPI, matchAPI, imageAPI which each communicate with userController, leagueController, matchController, imageController
Add GET functions for pictures ? Is it needed ?
Add DELETE functions for pictures
Delete someone's picture when uploading a new one
